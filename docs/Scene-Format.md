Weep Scene Format
=================

Scenes in Weep engine are described as a set of JSON files. This document attempts to document how things are organized and what properties are available. Currently scenes must mostly be authored by hand editing the JSON, although there is an incomplete Blender exporter in tools.

## Top level properties

Each json file should contain an object "{}" which can have one or more of the properties listed below. Order of the top level properties does not matter, although it makes sense to have them in the same order as here since that's the order they are processed.

* _"include"_: string or an array of strings referencing other json files that should be processed before interpreting the current file
* _"modules"_: array of strings containing the names of the code modules that should be loaded
* _"environment"_: environment configuration object (see below)
* _"fonts"_: font configuration object (see below)
* _"sounds"_: sound event configuration object (seel below)
* _"prefabs"_: object containing prefab definitions (objects that are not instantiated directly but rather act as prototypes for object instantiations); each key is the name of the prefab and the value follow regular object spec (see below)
* _"objects"_: array containing list if object instantiations (see below)

## Value formats

Whenever a property is listed to expect a vec2 or vec3, the value can be given either as an array of numbers or as a single number in which case all components use the given value. Colors can additionally be given as a hex string, either full form "#ff00ff" or shortened "#f0f". If a string is said to be hashed, it means that it's accessed from code with `$id(this-is-the-string)` syntax (resulting in uints instead of actual strings).

## Environment

* _"skybox"_: string (path to a skybox image or folder containing px.jpg, nx.jpg etc.) or array (paths to six side images) or null/undefined (procedural sky)
* _"exposure"_: float
* _"shadowDarkness"_: float
* _"bloomThreshold"_: float
* _"bloomIntensity"_: float
* _"tonemap"_: int
* _"ambient"_: color
* _"sunPosition"_: vec3
* _"sunColor"_: color
* _"fogColor"_: color
* _"fogDensity"_: float

## Fonts

Listed fonts can be used with the GUI system. Keys are hashed. Example:

	"fonts": {
		"title_font": {
			"path": "fonts/foo.ttf",
			"size": 48
		},
		"menu_font": {
			"path": "fonts/bar.ttf",
			"size": 24
		}
	}

## Sounds

The keys of the "sounds" object are ids (hashed) for sound events. The values for these keys are either strings (path to a .ogg sound file) or array of strings (multiple paths, one picked at random when the event id is played).

## Prefabs

These are read but no actual entities are generated. Instead they can be used as a template for actual objects. Format of individual prefab is the same as object defs specified below.

## Objects

Each object (entity) can have the following properties (most are optional):

* _"prefab"_: name of the prefab (key to a prefab object); if some property is not given in the object itself, a value from the prefab is used instead (if available)
* _"name"_: string, used for being able to retrieve the entity if needed, as well as for debugging purposes

	* _"spotAngles"_: inner and outer spot light angle in degrees
* _"geometry"_: one of:
	1. string path to .png or .jpg image to create heightmap from

	* _"localSpace"_: bool, if false, will simulate in world space, i.e. emitted particles will not follow emitter transform (default: false)
